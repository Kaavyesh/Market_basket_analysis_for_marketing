## Introduction

Market Basket Analysis is a valuable tool for retailers. It helps uncover which products are often bought together, allowing businesses to improve store layouts, cross-sell, and target customers more effectively. This project demonstrates the process of performing Market Basket Analysis using Python and data from a retail dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have performed the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We cleaned and transformed the raw data, converting it into transaction data.

2. **Encoding Transactions**: We utilized the MLxtend library to preprocess and encode the data, making it suitable for market basket analysis.

3. **Apriori Algorithm**: We applied the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on these itemsets.

4. **Visualization**: We visualized the results, including popular items, monthly transactions, weekly patterns, and more.

## Key Insights

The project has revealed several key insights:

- Coffee, Bread, and Tea are among the most popular items in the dataset.
- We observed variations in transaction volumes across different months, weekdays, and hours.
- Strong associations were found between items, such as Cake and Coffee, which are often purchased together.
